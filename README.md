A collection of projects I worked on that I'm proud of.

# DOOM YEETERNAL
  - A project from my senior year in high school. Finished in a month and working hybrid with a group, I focused on UI/UX, story, sprite design, boss design, and gameplay balance. The title of the game is a pun of our comp sci professor, Mr. Yee.

# CSE 13s/101 Assignments
  - A slurry of assignments from UCSC's C & C++ data structures and algorithms classes that I'm proud of. Psuedocode was given for program flow, but all code is my own. These were made to run on an Ubuntu VM.
      - CSE13 ( C ):
          - PA7: Huffman Encoder
          - Pa6: 1984-style language filter using hash tables and bloom filters
      - CSE101 ( C++ ):
          - PA8: Red-Black tree powered Dictionary to tokenize and read a text file.
