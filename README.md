A collection of projects I worked on that I'm proud of.

# DOOM YEETERNAL
  - A project from my senior year in high school. Finished in a month and working hybrid with a group, I focused on UI/UX, story, sprite design, boss design, and gameplay balance. The title of the game is a pun of our comp sci professor, Mr. Yee.
