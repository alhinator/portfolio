A collection of projects I worked on that I'm proud of.

# DOOM YEETERNAL
  - A project from my senior year in high school. Finished in a month and working hybrid with a group, I focused on UI/UX, story, sprite design, boss design, and gameplay balance. The title of the game is a pun of our comp sci professor, Mr. Yee.

# Cyber Heist
  - The other project from my senior year in high school. Due to COVID constraints, it didn't turn out as well-polished as I'd hoped, as well as some team miscommunication, but the project was very fun nevertheless, and gave me experience with level design and Unity's 3d engine.

# CSE 13s/101 Assignments
  - A few assignments from UCSC's C & C++ data structures and algorithms classes. Psuedocode was given for program flow, but all code is my own. These were made to run on an Ubuntu VM.
      - CSE13 ( C ):
          - PA7: Huffman Encoder
          - Pa6: 1984-style language filter using hash tables and bloom filters
      - CSE101 ( C++ ):
          - PA8: Red-Black tree powered Dictionary to tokenize and read a text file.

# CMPM 176 Game Systems Final Project - "Ocean's Heist"
  - A UCSC game design class in which systemic game design was heavily emphasized; it culminated in the creation of this card game over one month with a team, based on the prompt: "Adapt a TV series, film, play, manga, etc. to a systems-focused board (or card) game."
  - The game was playtested over five times with different groups, rebalanced many times, and ended up being an experience of "we should have gotten physical cards sooner". Overall, the project was successful, and I may end up continuing development in the future.

# BATTLESHIP
  - The first video game I ever made from scratch on a team. Programmed in Java over about a month in my second year of high school, this game contains exactly zero lines of readable code and thousands of lines of gourmet italian pasta dinner. God turns a blind eye to its inner machinations.

# Bridge
  - The blueprint of a bridge I made in senior year of high school. It was so sturdy, it was able to withstand somewhere over 15 pounds of load. (The piezoelectric sensor maxed out at 15, but we just kept adding weight until the bridge broke.)
